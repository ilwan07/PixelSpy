Settings area: connect your mailing service for direct use, set some IP addresses to specific names,
set a way to get notified when a mail was read,
edit an ip blacklist (the user should put the ip of his devices there so it won't mark mails as read when he opens them himself)

[On each one, see if it has been opened (colors)] with the ip/name of the last person opening it and the date,
and the number of times it's been loaded

When selecting an entry, you can see the message (if sent directly from the page), [ip of receiver]
(you can set the ip to a name directly if it's unknown) [as well as full response header metadata]
formated as a human readable format, and a way to remove the entry and therefore delete the pixel

You can go to a page where you can create a new spy agent, with the choice of either sending a spy mail directly from the page using your address,
or to get a link to the spy pixel, you can also choose your own image, and choosing to get notified or not for this message
then send it with the message from your mail app, then go back to the page to enable monitoring

force the user to verify mail?
Allow the user to use a custom image instead of the default transparent pixel
Require the user to accept conditions before registering
