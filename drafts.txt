set a way to get notified when a link was clicked,
edit an ip blacklist (the user should put the ip of his devices there so it won't track if he opens the link himself)

[On each one, see if it has been clicked (colors)] with the number of times it's been loaded

When selecting an entry, you can see the [ip of the person clicking]
(you can set the ip to a name directly if it's unknown)
and a way to remove the entry and therefore delete the shortened link, therefore returning 404 error

You can go to a page where you can create a new spy url and choose to get notified or not for this tracked url
